# Source files for the mediAid self-diagnostic online tool

This repo contains the client-side code for mediAid, a web based symptom checker built using React. Data on all symptoms available on the program are obtained from [The mediAid API](https://medi-aid-server.herokuapp.com/symptoms).

-The application is currently still in development, and collaborators, ideas, interface improvements and bug fixes are definitely welcome. If you have any any issues or questions regarding the project, feel free to reach out to me. In addition, there are only 12 symptoms available to diagnose for on the system at the moment. I am looking to research more medically accurate information to increase the list of available symptoms and diagnoses as well as the amount of medical information available on the database

## Program features

- The provision of a list of diagnoses based on symptoms inputted and symptom related questions answered by users
- Detailed and medically accurate information on all diagnoses returned by the application
- Highly likely and less likely diagnoses grouped into two categories based on symptoms inputted by users
- Triage and first-aid advice on all available diagnoses
- A read-aloud feature which reads first aid advice out loud to users by means of the Javascript Web Speech API
